<h2>8/10/20 - Introduction to our course (I missed this)</h2>

<h2>13/10/2020- Setting up and tools</h2>

<p>Todays sessions, we were introduced to git/ github. We   were shown a quick demo on the advantages of using vs code. We installed an extension onto VS code. We have done an introductory demonstration of how to commit changes in files to a repo that we cloned onto our machine. 
    <br>We also learnt how Github stores the changes we make to the code:
    <br>Yellow = changes made to the code
    <br>Green = created file
    <br>Red = deleted file
    <br>Remember to save everytime I write new code so that the changes are saved. 
    <br>Good places to learn to code:

<h2>15/10/20</h2>

<p>Today, I learnt how to make a master code (or website) in VIP code --> can create branches (can make changes that will only affect the branch I am working in) --> can merge this back with the main code or website.</p>

<h2>20/10/20 - HTML</h2>

<p>Today, I learnt about accessibility, tags, elements, attributes.
<l>
html - structural
css - presentation
javascript - behavioural
</l>
<br/> The following information was taken from w3schools, I learn a lot from this website:
    <br/>The &lt;head&gt; element contains meta information about the HTML page
    <br/>The &lt;title&gt; element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
    <br/>The &lt;body&gt; element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
    <br/>The &lt;h1&gt; element defines a large heading
    <br/>The &lt;p&gt; element defines a paragraph

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>
<p>Another paragraph.</p>
<h2>My Second Heading</h2>
<h3>My Third Heading</h3>
<h4>My Fourth Heading</h4>
<h5>My Fifth Heading</h5>
<h6>My Sixth Heading</h6>

<br>The following link is a good place to access free pictures and videos.

<br>Comments in our code are also important. They aren't seen by the browser and are only visible when viewing the code.
</p>

<h2>22/10/20 - CSS</h2>

<p>Today, I learnt how CSS is only used for the decoration and layout of a website. It works in conjunction with HTML. 
    <br>I did a quiz to test my knowledge of HTML. 
    <br>My score was 33/40. I got 82% of the answers correct and spent approximately 20 minutes completing the test.

    </p>

<h2>27/10/20 - HTML & CSS</h2>

<p>Today, I learnt how CSS works from top to bottom, so any code that is at the bottom, overrides anything that may be specified further up. 
    
    <br>I learnt that:
    <li>#id selector styles the element with the specified id</li> 
    <li>The div seperate each section of code from another section of code - can use this for nesting</li>
    <li>@fontface = imports a font</li>
    <li>When selecting fonts in our code, we can list fonts. Therefore, if one font can't be loaded in a specific browser, then it will try to load one of the other fonts</li>
</p>

<h2>29/10/20 - HTML & CSS- with Luke</h2>


<p>Today, I learnt more about how CSS works in conjunction with html. 
    
    <br>I learnt that:
    <li>the div tag holds all of the content. It works as a utility tag that essentially divides a page.</li> 
    <li>&lt;div class="alighn-right&gt;= can use this in css and add decoration.</li>
    <li>&lt;aside&gt;=something that isn't related to the rest of the content.</li>
    <li>Can use the margin (auto) to centre things on a page. This can also be done using wrappers.</li>
    <li>A shortcut to create the header, main and footer tags = header+main+footer</li>
    <li>The hashtage sign creates an id.</li>
    <li>Relative = positioned relative to its normal position.</li>
    <li>Absolute= this element stays in the same position. It's always fixed.</li>
</p>

<h2>03/11/20 - HTML & CSS- with Luke</h2>


<p>Today, I learnt more about how CSS works in conjunction with html. 
    
    <br>I learnt that:
    <li>z index is when elements overlap.</li> 
    <li>Floats = allow you to float an element to the left and right. Other elements will respet it's area. We need to specifiy the width so that the elements know how much space to use.</li>
    <li>Clear = tells an element to stay "clear" of, for example, the left hand side of the page when another element is there (such as a floating element or an image). It tells he element to the drop to the next available space, below the floating element.</li>
    <li>CSS Framewors = frameworks and libraries help us with common tasks (can use these in prototypes and typically not used in final projects).</li>
    <li>E.g. Bootstrap and Tailwind have CSS templates, icons etc. </li>
