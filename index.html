<h2>8/10/20 - Introduction to our course (I missed this)</h2>

<h2>13/10/2020- Setting up and tools</h2>

<p>Todays sessions, we were introduced to git/ github. We   were shown a quick demo on the advantages of using vs code. We installed an extension onto VS code. We have done an introductory demonstration of how to commit changes in files to a repo that we cloned onto our machine. 
    <br>We also learnt how Github stores the changes we make to the code:
    <br>Yellow = changes made to the code
    <br>Green = created file
    <br>Red = deleted file
    <br>Remember to save everytime I write new code so that the changes are saved.

<h2>15/10/20</h2>

<p>Today, I learnt how to make a master code (or website) in VIP code --> can create branches (can make changes that will only affect the branch I am working in) --> can merge this back with the main code or website.</p>

<h2>20/10/20 - HTML</h2>

<p>Today, I learnt about accessibility, tags, elements, attributes.
<l>
html - structural
css - presentation
javascript - behavioural

<br/> The following information was taken from w3schools, I learn a lot from this website:
The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page
    <br/>The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
    <br/>The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
    <br/>The <h1> element defines a large heading
    <br/>The <p> element defines a paragraph

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>
<p>Another paragraph.</p>
<h2>My Second Heading</h2>
<h3>My Third Heading</h3>
<h4>My Fourth Heading</h4>
<h5>My Fifth Heading</h5>
<h6>My Sixth Heading</h6>

<br>The following link is a good place to access free pictures and videos.

<br>Comments in our code are also important. They aren't seen by the browser and are only visible when viewing the code.
</p>

<h2>22/10/20 - CSS</h2>

<p>Today, I learnt how CSS is only used for the decoration and layout of a website. It works in conjunction with HTML. 
    <br>I did a quiz to test my knowledge of HTML. 
    <br>My score was 33/40. I got 82% of the answers correct and spent approximately 20 minutes completing the test.
