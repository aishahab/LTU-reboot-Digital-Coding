Reflection
In todays sessions, we were introduced to git/ github. We were shown a quick demo on the advantages of using vs code. We installed an extension onto VS code. We have done an introductory demonstration of how to commit changes in files to a repo that we cloned onto our machine. 
We also learnt how Github stores the changes we make to the code:
Yellow = changes made to the code
Green = created file
Red = deleted file
Remember to save everytime I write new code so that the changes are saved. 
Good places to learn to code:
